# Introduction

This template and class file "`asce-quarto.cls`", based on Matthew R. Kuhn's "`ascelike-new.cls`",produce manuscripts that comply with the guidelines of the American Society of Civil
Engineers (ASCE). The original "`ascelike-new.cls`" class has been produced by [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) in conjunction with the "`ascelike-new.bst`" citation style developed by Matthew R. Kuhn.

The "`asce-quarto.cls`" differs from "`ascelike-new.cls`" in that, the citation and bibliography related contents in the latter have been removed. Citation and bibliography styles are now handled using citation language style "`ascelike.cls`" with Pandoc's `citproc` via Quarto.


This template provides guidance on how to prepare your manuscript
according to the ASCE requirements, including details on how to use
various LaTeX commands to achieve the appropriate formatting. Additional
template options are given in Appendix [-@sec-app-options]. If you
have any questions about this template, or need help with LaTeX, please
[contact Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/contact) who can provide
assistance as required.

Once your work is complete, please use the "Submit to ASCE" option in
Overleaf to select the appropriate journal for your manuscript and
follow the instructions to complete your submission.

For more information on the ASCE, and to access additional resources for
authors, please visit the [ASCE Library
website](http://ascelibrary.org/page/authors).

# Preparing Your Manuscript

## Length

For most ASCE journals, the maximum length for technical papers and case
studies is 30 double-spaced manuscript pages including references,
figures, tables, and captions; 7 double-spaced manuscript pages for
technical notes; and 4 double-spaced manuscript pages for discussions
and closures. The editor may waive these restrictions to encourage
manuscripts on topics that cannot be treated within these limitations.
See the ["Publishing in ASCE Journals: A Guide for
Authors"](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/9780784479018) for
information on other article types.

## General Flow of the Paper

Sections of the article should not be numbered and use word headings
only. Article sections should appear in the following order:

-   Title page content (includes title, author byline & affiliation,
    abstract)

-   Introduction

-   Main text sections

-   Conclusion

-   Appendix(es)

-   Data Availability Statement

-   Acknowledgments

-   Disclaimers

-   Notation list

-   Supplemental Materials

-   References

## Title

Titles should be no longer than 100 characters including spaces. The
title of a paper is the first "description" of a paper found via search
engine. Authors should take care to ensure that the title is specific
and accurately reflects the final, post-peer reviewed version of the
paper. Authors should try to include relevant search terms in the title
of the paper to maximize discoverability online. Titles should not begin
with "A," "An," "The," "Analysis of," "Theory of," "On the," "Toward,"
etc.

## Author Bylines

Under the title of the manuscript, the full name of each author and his
or her affiliation and professional designation, if applicable, must be
included. The following academic and professional designations are
currently acceptable for all journals: Ph.D., Dr.Tech., Dr.Eng., D.Sc.,
Sc.D., J.D., P.E., S.E., D.WRE, Hon.D.WRE, D.GE, D.CE, D.OE, D.PE, D.NE,
NAE, DEE, P.Eng., CEng, L.S., P.L.S., G.E., P.G., P.H., RA, AICP, and
CPEng.

Former affiliations are permissible only if an author's affiliation has
changed after a manuscript has been submitted for publication. If a
coauthor has passed away, include the date of death in the affiliation
line. Any manuscript submitted without a separate affiliation statement
for each author will be returned to the corresponding author for
correction.

## Gender-specific Words

Authors should avoid "he," "she," "his," "her," and "hers."
Alternatively, words such as "author," "discusser," "engineer," and
"researcher" should be used.

## Footnotes and Endnotes

Footnotes and endnotes are not permitted in the text. Authors must
incorporate any necessary information within the text of the manuscript.

**Exception** - Endnotes are only permitted for use in the *Journal of
Legal Affairs and Dispute Resolution in Engineering and Construction*.

## SI Units

The use of Syst√®me Internationale (SI) units as the primary units of
measure is mandatory. Other units of measurement may be given in
parentheses after the SI unit if the author desires. More information
about SI units can be found on the [NIST
website](http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/index.html).

## Conclusions

At the end of the manuscript text, authors must include a set of
conclusions, or summary and conclusion, in which the significant
implications of the information presented in the body of the text are
reviewed. Authors are encouraged to explicitly state in the conclusions
how the work presented contributes to the overall body of knowledge for
the profession.

## Data Availability Statement

When submitting a new and revised manuscript, authors are asked to
include a data availability statement containing one or more of the
following statements, with specific items listed as appropriate. Please
include one or more of the statements below, deleting those which do not
apply. This section should appear directly before the Acknowledgments
section.

-   Some or all data, models, or code generated or used during the study
    are available in a repository online in accordance with funder data
    retention policies (provide full citations that include URLS or
    DOIs)

-   Some or all data, models, or code used during the study were
    provided by a third party (list items). Direct requests for these
    materials may be made to the provider as indicated in the
    Acknowledgements.

-   Some or all data, models, or code that support the findings of this
    study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable
    request (list items).

-   Some or all data, models, or code generated or used during the study
    are proprietary or confidential in nature and may only be provided
    with restrictions (e.g. anonymized data) (List items and
    restrictions).

-   All data, models, and code generated or used during the study appear
    in the submitted article.

-   No data, models, or code were generated or used during the study
    (e.g., opinion or data-less paper).

Please also see the guidelines at:
<https://ascelibrary.org/page/dataavailability>.

## Acknowledgments

Acknowledgments are encouraged as a way to thank those who have
contributed to the research or project but did not merit being listed as
an author. The Acknowledgments should indicate what each person did to
contribute to the project.

Authors can include an Acknowledgments section to recognize any advisory
or financial help received. This section should appear after the
Conclusions and before the references. Authors are responsible for
ensuring that funding declarations match what was provided in the
manuscript submission system as part of the FundRef query. Discrepancies
may result in delays in publication.

## Mathematics

All displayed equations should be numbered sequentially throughout the
entire manuscript, including Appendixes. Equations should be in the body
of a manuscript; complex equations in tables and figures are to be
avoided, and numbered equations are never permitted in figures and
tables. Here is an example of a displayed equation
(@eq-Einstein)

$$
E = m c^{2}
$$ {#eq-Einstein}

Symbols should be listed alphabetically in a section called "Notation"
at the end of the manuscript (preceding the references). See the
folliowing section for more details.

## Notation List

Notation lists are optional; however, authors choosing to include one
should follow these guidelines:

-   List all items alphabetically.

-   Capital letters should precede lowercase letters.

-   The Greek alphabet begins after the last letter of the English
    alphabet.

-   Non-alphabetical symbols follow the Greek alphabet.

Notation lists should always begin with the phrase, "*The following
symbols are used in this paper:*"; acronyms and abbreviations are not
permitted in the Notation list except when they are used in equations as
variables. Definitions should end with a semicolon. An example Notation
list has been included in this template; see Appendix [-@sec-app-notation].

## Appendixes

Appendixes can be used to record details and data that are of secondary
importance or are needed to support assertions in the text. The main
body of the text must contain references to all Appendixes. Any tables
or figures in Appendixes should be numbered sequentially, following the
numbering of these elements in the text. Appendixes must contain some
text, and need to be more than just figures and/or tables. Appendixes
containing forms or questionnaires should be submitted as Supplemental
Materials instead.

# Sections, subsections, equations, etc.

This section is included to explain and to test the formatting of
sections, subsections, subsubsections, equations, tables, and figures.

Section heading are automatically made uppercase; to include mathematics
or symbols in a section heading, you can use the `\lowercase{}` around
the content, e.g. `\lowercase{\boldmath$c^{2}$}`.

## An Example Subsection

No automatic capitalization occurs with subsection headings; you will
need to capitalize the first letter of each word, as in "An Example
Subsection."

### An example subsubsection

No automatic capitalization occurs with subsubsections; you will need to
capitalize only the first letter of subsubsection headings.

# Figures and Tables

This template includes two examples of figure (@fig-fill-between, @fig-asce-logo) and a table
(@tbl-assembly). 
@fig-fill-between is a computed figure with python. 
It has a caption with no more information than the figure itself, a very poor practice indeed.
A reference here [@Stahl:2004a].

```{python}
#| label: fig-fill-between
#| fig-cap: An example figure.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# use SciencePlots package
# to install the latest release (from PyPI)
# pip install SciencePlots

# to install the latest commit (from GitHub)
# pip install git+https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots

# plt.style.use(['science','ieee']) 

np.random.seed(1)
x = np.linspace(0, 8, 16)
y1 = 3 + 4*x/8 + np.random.uniform(0.0, 0.5, len(x))
y2 = 1 + 2*x/8 + np.random.uniform(0.0, 0.5, len(x))

# plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.fill_between(x, y1, y2, alpha=.5, linewidth=0)
ax.plot(x, (y1 + y2)/2, linewidth=2)

ax.set(xlim=(0, 8), xticks=np.arange(1, 8),
       ylim=(0, 8), yticks=np.arange(1, 8))

plt.show()

```

@fig-asce-logo is a figure of `pdf` format.

## Figure Captions

Figure captions should be short and to the point; they need not include
a complete explanation of the figure.

## Figure Files

Figures should be uploaded as separate files in TIFF, EPS, or PDF
format. If using PDF format, authors must ensure that all fonts are
embedded before submission. Every figure must have a figure number and
be cited sequentially in the text.

::: {#fig-asce-logo}
![](./img/asce-logo.pdf)

:::

## Color Figures

Figures submitted in color will be published in color in the online
journal at no cost. Color figures provided must be suitable for printing
in black and white. Color figures that are ambiguous in black and white
will be returned to the author for revision, and will delay publication.
Authors wishing to have figures printed in color must indicate this in
the submission questions. There is a fee for publishing color figures in
print.

## Table Format

The following is a guide to preparing tables as part of your submission

-   Vertical rules should not be used in tables. Horizontal rules are
    used to offset column headings at the top of the table and footnotes
    (if any) at the bottom of the table and to separate major sections.

-   All columns must have a heading. Each table should have only one set
    of column headings at the top of the table. Using additional column
    headings within the body of the table should be avoided.

-   Photographs, sketches, line art, or other graphic elements are not
    permitted in tables. Any table that includes graphics must be
    treated and numbered as a figure.

-   Highlighting and shading are also not permitted and will not be
    reproduced in print. Boldface font should be used for emphasis
    sparingly.

-   Equations are allowed in the table body, but should be avoided if
    possible. Numbered equations are never allowed in tables.

-   Tables should not be submitted in multiple parts (Table 1a, 1b,
    etc.). Tables with multiple parts should either be combined into one
    table or split into separate tables.

|$\ast$ $D_{50}$ represents the median particle diameter|

# Figure, Table and Text Permissions

Authors are responsible for obtaining permission for each figure,
photograph, table, map, material from a Web page, or significant amount
of text published previously or created by someone other than the
author. Permission statements must indicate permission for use online as
well as in print.

ASCE will not publish a manuscript if any text, graphic, table, or
photograph has unclear permission status. Authors are responsible for
paying any fees associated with permission to publish any material. If
the copyright holder requests a copy of the journal in which his or her
figure is used, the corresponding author is responsible for obtaining a
copy of the journal.


# Supplemental Materials

Supplemental Materials are considered to be data too large to be
submitted comfortably for print publication (e.g., movie files, audio
files, animated .gifs, 3D rendering files) as well as color figures,
data tables, and text (e.g., Appendixes) that serve to enhance the
article, but are not considered vital to support the science presented
in the article. A complete understanding of the article does not depend
upon viewing or hearing the Supplemental Materials.

Supplemental Materials must be submitted for inclusion in the online
version of any ASCE journal via Editorial Manager at the time of
submission.

Decisions about whether to include Supplemental Materials will be made
by the relevant journal editor as part of the article acceptance
process. Supplemental Materials files will be posted online as supplied.
They will not be checked for accuracy, copyedited, typeset, or
proofread. The responsibility for scientific accuracy and file
functionality remains with the authors. A disclaimer will be displayed
to this effect with any supplemental materials published online. ASCE
does not provide technical support for the creation of supplemental
materials.

ASCE will only publish Supplemental Materials subject to full copyright
clearance. This means that if the content of the file is not original to
the author, then the author will be responsible for clearing all
permissions prior to publication. The author will be required to provide
written copies of permissions and details of the correct copyright
acknowledgment. If the content of the file is original to the author,
then it will be covered by the same Copyright Transfer Agreement as the
rest of the article.

Supplemental Materials must be briefly described in the manuscript with
direct reference to each item, such as Figure S1, Table S1, Protocol S1,
Audio S1, and Video S1 (numbering should always start at 1, since these
elements will be numbered independently from those that will appear in
the printed version of the article). Text within the supplemental
materials must follow journal style. Links to websites other than a
permanent public repository are not an acceptable alternative because
they are not permanent archives.

When an author submits supplemental materials along with a manuscript,
the author must include a section entitled "Supplemental Materials"
within the manuscript. This section should be placed immediately before
the References section. This section should only contain a direct list
of what is included in the supplemental materials, and where those
materials can be found online. Descriptions of the supplemental
materials should not be included here. An example of appropriate text
for this section is "Figs. S1--S22 are available online in the ASCE
Library ([ascelibrary.org](http://ascelibrary.org/))."

# References, Citations and bibliographic entries

ASCE uses the author-date method for in-text references, whereby the
source reads as the last names of the authors, then the year (e.g.,
Smith 2004 or Smith and Jones 2004). A References section must be
included that lists all references alphabetically by last name of the
first author.

When used together, `asce-quarto.cls` and `asce.csl` produce
citations and the References section in the correct format
automatically.

References must be published works only. Exceptions to this rule are
theses, dissertations, and "in press" articles, all of which are allowed
in the References list. References cited in text that are not found in
the reference list will be deleted but queried by the copyeditor.
Likewise, all references included in the References section must be
cited in the text.

The citation options are available at [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html). 
For example, `[-@Ireland:1954a]` produces the year information, [-@Ireland:1954a], only.

The bibliographic data base `ascexmpl-new.bib` gives examples of
bibliographic entries for different document types. These entries are
from the canonical set in the ASCE web document "Instructions For
Preparation Of Electronic Manuscripts" and from the ASCE website. The
References section of this document has been automatically created with
the `asce.csl` style for the following entries:

-   a book [@Goossens:1994a],

-   an anonymous book [@Moody:1988a],

-   an anonymous report using `@MANUAL` [@FHWA:1991a],

-   a journal article [@Stahl:2004a; @Pennoni:1992a],

-   a journal article in press [@Dasgupta:2008a],

-   an article in an edited book using `@INCOLLECTION` [@Zadeh:1981a],

-   a building code using `@MANUAL` [@ICBO:1988a],

-   a discussion of an `@ARTICLE` [@Vesilind:1992a],

-   a masters thesis using `@MASTERSTHESIS` [@Sotiropulos:1991a],

-   a doctoral thesis using `@PHDTHESIS` [@Chang:1987a],

-   a paper in a foreign journal [@Ireland:1954a],

-   a paper in a proceedings using `@INPROCEEDINGS`
    [@Eshenaur:1991a; @Garrett:2003a],

-   a standard using `@INCOLLECTION` [@ASTM:1991a],

-   a translated book [@Melan:1913a],

-   a two-part paper [@Frater:1992a; @Frater:1992b],

-   a university report using `@TECHREPORT` [@Duan:1990a],

-   an untitled item in the Federal Register using `@MANUAL`
    [@FR:1968a],

-   works in a foreign language [@Duvant:1972a; @Reiffenstuhl:1982a],

-   software using `@MANUAL` [@Lotus:1985a],

-   two works by the same author in the same year
    [@Gaspar:2001b; @Gaspar:2001a], and

-   two works by three authors in the same year that only share the
    first two authors [@Huang2009a; @Huang2009b].

ASCE has added two types of bibliographic entries: webpages and CD-ROMs.
A webpage can be formated using the `@MISC` entry category, as with the
item [@Burka:1993a] produced with the following `*.bib` entry:

        @MISC{Burka:1993a,
          author = {Burka, L. P.},
          title = {A hypertext history of multi-user dimensions},
          journal = {MUD history},
          year = {1993},
          month = {Dec. 5, 1994},
          url = {http://www.ccs.neu.edu}
        }

Notice the use of the "`month`" field to give the date that material was
downloaded and the use of a new "`url`" field. The "`url`" and `month`"
fields can also be used with other entry types (i.e., `@BOOK`,
`@INPROCEEDINGS`, `@MANUAL`, `@MASTERSTHESIS`, `@PHDTHESIS`, and
`@TECHREPORT`): for example, in the entry type `@PHDTHESIS` for
[@Wichtmann:2005a].

A CD-ROM can be referenced when using the `@BOOK`, `@INBOOK`,
`@INCOLLECTION`, or `@INPROCEEDINGS` categories, as in the entry
[@Liggett:1998a]. The field "`howpublished`" is used to designate the
medium in the `.bib` file:

        howpublished = {CD-ROM},

## Authors and affiliations

For now, I prefer to use a simplified way to define the authors and affiliations: just use `name`, `affiliations`, `email` and `corresponding` fields. See above `yaml` header. 
I may change this in the future.

For more detailed setups, see [quarto document](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/authors.html).

## Format options

The document class `asce-quarto.cls` provides several options given
below. 

### Publication types

The `Proceedings|Journal|NewProceedings` option is the most
important; the other options are largely incidental.

In a quarto document, use `publication-type` to specify the overall format.

1.  Options `Journal|Proceedings|NewProceedings` specify the overall
    format of the output manuscript.

    `Journal` produces double-spaced manuscripts for ASCE journals. As
    default settings, it places tables and figures at the end of the
    manuscript and produces lists of tables and figures. It places line
    numbers within the left margin.

    `Proceedings` produces older-style camera-ready single-spaced
    manuscripts for ASCE conference proceedings. The newer ASCE style is
    enacted with the `NewProceedings` option.

    `NewProceedings` produces newer-style single-spaced manuscripts for
    ASCE conference proceedings, as shown on the ASCE website (*ca.*
    2013). As default settings, `NewProceedings` places figures and
    tables within the text. It does not place line numbers within the
    left margin.

    If desired, the bottom right corner can be "tagged" with the
    author's name (this can be done by inserting the command
    `\NameTag{<`*your name*`>}` within the preamble of your document).
    All of the default settings can be altered with the options that are
    described below.

### Fine-tuning options

Use `classoption` to specify the following options.

2.  Options `BackFigs|InsideFigs` can be used to override the default
    placement of tables and figures in the `Journal`, `Proceedings`, and
    `NewProceedings` formats.

3.  Options `SingleSpace|DoubleSpace` can be used to override the
    default text spacing in the `Journal`, `Proceedings`, and
    `NewProceedings` formats.

4.  Options `10pt|11pt|12pt` can be used to override the default text
    size (12pt).

5.  The option `NoLists` suppresses inclusion of lists of tables and
    figures that would normally be included in the `Journal` format.

6.  The option `NoPageNumbers` suppresses the printing of page numbers.

7.  The option `SectionNumbers` produces an automatic numbering of
    sections. Without the `SectionNumbers` option, sections will *not*
    be numbered, as this seems to be the usual formatting in ASCE
    journals (note that the Appendixes will, however, be automatically
    "numbered" with Roman numerals). With the `SectionNumbers` option,
    sections and subsections are numbered with Arabic numerals (e.g. 2,
    2.1, etc.), but subsubsection headings will not be numbered.

8.  The options `NoLineNumbers|LineNumbers` can be used to override the
    default use (or absence) of line numbers in the `Journal`,
    `Proceedings`, and `NewProceedings` formats.
